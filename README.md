LaCyTools is open-source software for researcher focussing on chromatgraphy coupled to mass spectrometry. It includes modules for retention time and m/z calibration, peak integration, quality control and more. The tool was first described in a 2016 Journal of Proteome Research article, located at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00171

LaCyTools depends on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib. NumPy and SciPy are used predominantly for data fitting and numerical operations on arrays. Matplotlib is used to draw all of the graphical elements that are used/created by LaCyToolsTools in both the GUI and the images. LaCyTools is currently undergoing refactoring work (as part of the Python3 upgrade) to allow it to also work as a package, allowing easy access to all of it's functionality. However, the refactoring requires a significant amount of coding and therefore, we request that you inform us about any issues that you might encounter using the above mentioned bug reports page.
